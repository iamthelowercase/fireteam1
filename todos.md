## ROOMS AND FLOORS
* Create multiple types of floor generation systems
    * including a BSP-based floor generator
* create mulitple types of rooms to generate in room-based generation
* figure out where to put the decision between types of floor generation
* come up with multiple types of "non-rooms" (CF tunnels)
    * implement generation functions for them
    * refactor the basic tunnel function to dig really simple tunnels and one or more caller functions to use it

## UI
* figure out how to handle control of multiple characters in a non-turn-based system
    * there are multiple possible control schemes.  Think of more than one, then compare them
* figure out how to *display* control of multiple characters
