## FIRETEAM! ##
A Roguelike

Fireteam! is (going to be) a classic-ish roguelike with multiple player characters in play simultaneously.

It is *not*:
* A turn-based strategy game.
* A real-time roguelike.

For historical reasons, README files typically contain installation guidlines.  You may want [About.md](./About.md) instead.

# Origins
Fireteam! started life as part of [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/)'s 2025 [complete roguelike tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/).  Parts of the code are still (lightly updated, for newer versions) directly from the tutorial.

Fireteam! is directly inspired by DRL.

# Installation
Fireteam! uses Python3 and tcod 18.1.  The requirements.txt file should list the non-Python3 requirements for easy PIP ingestion (but needs to be updated as of this writing).
